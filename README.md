# GsmaeB

GsmaeB is a simple, modern Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use. It tries to minimize noise and maximize space for
content; the only visual flourish it offers is an (optional) progress bar added to each slide. The core design
principles of the theme were described in a blog post
[here](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).

## Installation

Installing GsmaeB from source, like any Beamer theme, involves four easy steps:

1. **Download the source** with a `git clone` of the [GsmaeB repository](https://github.com/yongzhengqi/gsmaeb).
2. **Compile the style files** by running `make sty` inside the downloaded directory. (Or run LaTeX directly
   on `source/beamerthemegsmaeb.ins`.)
3. **Move the resulting `*.sty` files** to the folder containing your presentation. To use Metropolis with many
   presentations, run `make install`
   or move the `*.sty` files to a folder in your TeX path instead (might require
   `sudo` rights).
4. **Use the theme for your presentation** by declaring `\usetheme{gsmaeb}` in the preamble of your Beamer document.
5. **For best results** install Mozilla's [Fira Sans](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraSans).

## Usage

The following code shows a minimal example of a Beamer presentation using GsmaeB.

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{gsmaeb}           % Use GsmaeB theme
